INPUT FILES
=======

`PHRAPL` requires two types of input files: an assignment file (e.g. cladeAssignments.txt) and a file with all phylogenetic trees in **newik** format (e.g. trees.tre). The file of trees must include one tree per gene or independent marker. __All files must have the same taxon names (labels) for individuals across all loci.__
