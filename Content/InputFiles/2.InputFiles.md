INPUT FILES
=======

`PHRAPL` requires two input files: an **assignment file** (e.g. cladeAssignments.txt) and a file with **phylogenetic trees in newik** format (e.g. trees.tre). The file of trees must include one tree per gene or independent marker. __**<font color='#ff7700'>All files must have the same taxon names (labels) across all loci.</font>__

**You can have missing data.** `PHRAPL` does not require each gene tree to include all individuals/alleles per population/species, but need to include at least 2 or 3 preferably.
