INPUT FILES
=======

`PHRAPL` requires two input files: an **assignment file** (e.g. cladeAssignments.txt) and a file with **phylogenetic trees in newik** format (e.g. trees.tre). __<font color='#ff7700'>All files must have the same taxon names (labels) across all loci.</font>__

**You can have missing data.** `PHRAPL` does not require gene trees to include all individuals/alleles per population/species/group.

**You can include both haploid and diploid data in the same analyses** using the argument `popScaling` in the `GridSearch` function.
