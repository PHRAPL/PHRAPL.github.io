INPUT FILES
=======

`PHRAPL` requires two types of input files: an assignment file (e.g. cladeAssignments.txt) and a file with all phylogenetic trees in **newik** format (e.g. trees.tre). The file of trees must include one tree per gene or independent marker. __All files must have the same taxon names (labels) for individuals across all loci.__


# Gene trees
`PHRAPL` will use one file for all loci (locus1_tree; locus2_tree; locus3_tree; locusn_tree;) in **newick** format

```
## Example of a file for all phylogenetic trees for all loci  
((ind6,(ind4,ind5),ind11),(ind3,ind9),(((ind12,(ind10,ind7)),ind8),(ind1,ind2)));
(((((ind10,ind7,ind1),ind12),ind6),((ind11,ind2,ind9),ind8)),(ind3,(ind4,ind5)));
(((ind10,ind11),(((ind1,ind12,ind3),(ind2,ind4,ind8,(ind5,ind6))),ind9)),ind7);
```


## Merge all trees into one file
If the tree files are separated, there are two options to merge all the tree files in one:
*	In the shell (in your working directory): 
```
cat *.tre >> trees.tre
```

*	In phrapl use the function MergeTrees:  
```r
library(phrapl)
MergeTrees(treePath="/path_to_tree_files/")
```
