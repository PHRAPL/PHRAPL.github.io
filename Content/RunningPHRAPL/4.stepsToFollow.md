HOW MODELS ARE BUILT IN `PHRAPL`?
=======

To run `PHRAPL` you need is a set of models and you need to understand how these models are built. __Please take some time to read and understand the free parameters section.__
 

## Free parameters

`PHRAPL` will assign a certain number of free parameters (specified by the user or automatically) to __coalescent events, population sizes, and migration rates.__ The number of free parameters will constrain the possible number of histories (model space search). For _n_ sampled populations, the number of possible models will increase factorially.

### Population sizes
__For the moment__, the free parameters will only be assigned to migration rates and coalescent events. `PHRAPL` will always assign one parameter to population size, otherwise the populations do not exist. This parameter for the moment is not "free", and should not be counted to generate a 'migrationArray' object.


### Collapse (or coalescent) event 
There are $[(2n)-1]$ possible events of populations merging (coalescent events). Each coalescent event will require one parameter. If this value is 0, your system represents an island population model.


Fig. An example of free parameter assignments to coalescent events when K=1, K=2, and K=3. There are not migration events.

### Migration
There are $(N^2 - N)$ possible migration rates between populations.
