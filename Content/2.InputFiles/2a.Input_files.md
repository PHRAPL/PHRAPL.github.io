INPUT FILES
=======

`PHRAPL` requires two types of input files: an assignment file (e.g. cladeAssignments.txt) and a file with all phylogenetic trees in **newik** format (e.g. trees.tre). The file of trees must include one tree per gene or independent marker. __All files must have the same taxon names (labels) for individuals across all loci.__


# Assignment file
The assignment file (cladeAssignments.txt) specifies which individuals belong to which populations/species/groups. 

```
## Example of an input assignment file. 
# The first column lists individuals 
# The second column lists populations.
# This example does not include an outgroup.

ind1	A
ind2	A
ind3	A
ind4	B
ind5	B
ind6	B
ind7	C
ind8	C
ind9	C
ind10	D
ind11	D
ind12	D
```

If an outgroup is included in the analysis, it must be listed at the end.
```
## Example of input assignment file with an outgroup. 
# The first column lists individuals 
# The second column lists populations.
