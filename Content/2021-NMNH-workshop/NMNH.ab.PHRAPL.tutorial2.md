# Tutorial 2: Divergence with gene flow vs. secondary contact
{: .no_toc }

**<font color='#ff7700'>This tutorial assumes that you have already followed and understand the steps of <a href="https://phrapl.github.io/Content/2021-NMNH-workshop/NMNH.aa.PHRAPL.tutorial1.html">Tutorial 1</a></font>**

**The first part** of this tutorial will walk you through a `PHRAPL` analysis to **recalculate model weights (wAIC) in gradually increasing subsets of loci** and how to **handle haploid and diploid loci in the same analysis.** The figure below represents how results from these type of analyses could be summarized. Each column represents one model, each row represent a subset of loci (gradually increasing in number), and the color represents the model weight (wAIC analogous to model probability), that is higher as it gets darker.

Then, **the second part**, will show you how to **compare models of no gene flow, gene flow only during early stages of divergence, constant gene flow throughout time, or secondary contact** (as represented in the figure below, from left to right). To test such scenarios with different time intervals of gene flow, we use a model with a fixed topology and a fixed migration matrix (direction of gene flow between species or populations) that may be symmetric (red arrows in the figure) and/or asymmetric (green arrows in the figure). We assume that such a model was already inferred as the 'best' model from a bigger set in a previous analysis. **We only change when gene flow starts or stops.**

This is what we did in our ["Speciation with Gene Flow in North American *Myotis* Bats"](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/66/3/440/2682289) paper. For this tutorial, we use a smaller example dataset of 2 populations *Plethodon* salamanders. **We have highlighted with <font color="#ff7700">orange asterisks</font> those blocks of code that constitute the minimum steps that must be followed. <font color="#ff7700">Run all the commands in your shell terminal (not in your R terminal).</font> You can run Part 2 without having to run Part 1.**

#### Load input files from GitHub
Housekeeping commands to load libraries, input files, [a precomputed model set (a.k.a. migrationArray)](https://phrapl.github.io/Content/GenerateSetModels/3b.Generate_set_of_models.html), and create output directories.
```R
setwd("/working_path/sensitivityAnalyses")  # <----- Change this line if your are running the tutorial step by step

## Create output dirs
	system(paste0("mkdir ", getwd(),  "/results"))
	system(paste0("mkdir ", getwd(),  "/results/RoutFiles"))

## Load libraries and functions
library(ape)
library(partitions)
library(phrapl)

## migrationArray
load(url("https://github.com/ariadnamorales/phrapl-manual/raw/master/data/sensitivityAnalyses/example/input/MigrationArray_2pop_3K.rda"))

## Input Files
currentAssign<-read.table(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ariadnamorales/phrapl-manual/master/data/sensitivityAnalyses/example_with_outputFiles/input/Pleth_align.txt", head=TRUE)
currentTrees<-ape::read.tree("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ariadnamorales/phrapl-manual/master/data/sensitivityAnalyses/example_with_outputFiles/input/Pleth_bestTree.tre")

```

#### Subsampling
If you followed tutorial 1, you already know what is happening in `Subsampling` and `GridSearch`.

```r
########################
### 1. Subsampling  ####
########################

## Define arguments
subsamplesPerGene<-10 
nloci<-5						## IMPORTANT: one of these loci is haploid
popAssignments<-list(c(3,3))

    
## Do subsampling
observedTrees<-PrepSubsampling(assignmentsGlobal=currentAssign,observedTrees=currentTrees,
popAssignments=popAssignments,subsamplesPerGene=subsamplesPerGene,outgroup=FALSE,outgroupPrune=FALSE)

### You will see this error message:
### Warning messages:
#		1: In PrepSubsampling(assignmentsGlobal = currentAssign, observedTrees = currentTrees,  :
#	  Warning: Tree number  1 contains tip names not included in the inputted assignment file. These tips will not be subsampled.
### This is because we exclude a few individuals from the Assignment File to reduce computational time for the sake of this tutorial.

## Get subsample weights for phrapl
subsampleWeights.df<-GetPermutationWeightsAcrossSubsamples(popAssignments=popAssignments,observedTrees=observedTrees)

## Save subsampled Trees and weights
save(list=c("observedTrees","subsampleWeights.df"),file=paste0(getwd(),"/phraplInput_Pleth.rda"))
```


#### GridSearch
**Here, look at the `GridSearch` arguments `popScaling` and `print.ms.string`.** With `popScaling` you can specify if any (or all) of your loci is haploid (`0.25 Ne`) or diploid (`1 Ne`). The order of these values should match the order of the trees in your input file. In this example, a tree from mitochondrial locus is listed first. Setting `print.ms.string=TRUE` will allow you to use the output file to recalculate wAIC is subsets of loci, that file is named `1.Subsampling_GridSearch_Post.Rout` in this tutorial.

### Sensitivity analyses: generate subsets.

Each run will generate two files, one with extension **`rda`** and one with extension **`Rout`**. The **`rda`** files are used to post-process the results and calculate final model averages (as done above). The **`Rout`** files will contain information of the `GridSearch` performance, we are interested in the **match vector**, which contains information of the number of times that each subsample in each locus was found in the simulated distribution of trees. 

This figure represents a `GridSearch` output listing parameter grids, grid values (or grid points), running settings (such as nsam, nreps, opts), results (AIC and lnL), and the number of matches. There will be one list per model and per grid parameter combination.

<img src="https://github.com/ariadnamorales/phrapl-manual/blob/master/images/matchVector.png?raw=true" width="592.8" height="446.8" />

Before recalculating model averages per locus (or subset of loci), it is necessary to extract the **match vectors**. Then, the function `GenerateSetLoci` will re-calculate AICs and parameter estimates for subsets of loci. This can either be done for independent subsets of loci (`cumulative=FALSE`) or for cumulative subsets (`cumulative=TRUE`, in which the second subset is added to the first subset, and then the third subset is added to these, etc). `lociRange` gives the number of loci in the original analysis and `NintervalLoci` gives the desired number of loci in each subset, **which must be a multiple of the total number of loci**. If the models in the original analysis are only a subset of models in the `migrationArray`, this `modelRange` must be specified as well. The output of `GenerateSetLoci` is an **`rda`** file for each locus subset (numbered in order with a numerical suffix, i.e., _1, _2, _3, etc). Note that subsets are taken in order from the original output files.
**Note:** We are using a `GenerateSetLoci` version [downloaded with this tutorial's files](https://github.com/ariadnamorales/phrapl-manual/blob/master/data/GenerateSetLoci.R) (not the one included in the `phrapl`library). A few changes were made to make the process easier to follow. You can use it for further analyses, make sure to load it as a source file.

## **Part 2:** Constant vs ancestral vs recent gene flow

**You can run Part 2 without having to run Part 1.**
For this section **<font color='#ff7700'>make sure that you understand how `PHRAPL` models are structured in an R object.</font>** You need to be familiar with what is a `migrationArray` object and its components: `$collapseMatrix`, `$n0multiplierMap`, `$growthMap`, `$migrationArray`. [See this explanation](https://phrapl.github.io/Content/GenerateSetModels/3c.exploreMigrationArray.html) if you need a reminder.
* **Note**: the object `migrationArray`, is a `list` object that is **the model**, actually you can call it however you want. It includes an `array` called `$migrationArray` that includes the migration matrices within such model/object. This may be confusing but for historical reasons that is how it was developed...

### How to generate models with different time intervals of gene flow
To generate such models, we need to start with "traditional" `PHRAPL` models with and without gene flow. 
 
In this tutorial we, start with 2 models.

```r
## load R (if you havenÂ´t)
## Load libraries
library(phrapl)	

## get migrationArray with 2 models (no gene flow and asymmetric gene flow)
load(url("https://github.com/ariadnamorales/phrapl-manual/raw/master/data/tutorial2.2/models/MigrationArray_2Pops_2models_noMig_assymMig.rda"))

length(migrationArray)
#[1] 2
```



#### No gene flow

The first model includes 2 sister populations/species with a single coalescent event, same population size, no changes in  population size, and no gene flow. 

```r
migrationArray[[1]]
```

Returns this output:
```r
$collapseMatrix
     [,1]			## For these 2 groups/populations/species
[1,]    1			## there is only one coalescent event (seeing from the present to the past)
[2,]    1			## or single divergence event (fseeing rom the past to the present).

$complete
[1] TRUE

$n0multiplierMap	
     [,1]
[1,]    1					## Same population size in group/population/species 1  --> "1" 
[2,]    1					## Same population size in group/population/species 2  --> "1" 

$growthMap
     [,1]
[1,]    0					## No changes in population size in group/population/species 1  --> "0" 
[2,]    0					## No changes in population size in group/population/species 2  --> "0" 
					  
$migrationArray
, , 1					     ## There is only one ", , 1" interval assigned to gene flow
									 ## therefore, it is asummed to be constant
     [,1] [,2]		
[1,]   NA    0		 ## No gene flow from group [1,] to group [,2] --> "0" 
[2,]    0   NA		 ## No gene flow from group [2,] to group [,1] --> "0" 
```
#### Constant gene flow

The second model includes 2 sister populations/species with a single coalescent event, same population size, no changes in  population size, and gene flow from group 1 to group 2. 

```r
migrationArray[[2]]
```

Returns this output:
```r
$collapseMatrix
     [,1]			## For these 2 groups/populations/species
[1,]    1			## there is only one coalescent event (seeing from the present to the past)
[2,]    1			## or single divergence event (seeing from from the past to the present).

$complete
[1] TRUE

$n0multiplierMap	
     [,1]
[1,]    1			## Same population size in group/population/species 1  --> "1" 
[2,]    1			## Same population size in group/population/species 2  --> "1" 

$growthMap
     [,1]
[1,]    0			## No changes in population size in group/population/species 1  --> "0" 
[2,]    0			## No changes in population size in group/population/species 2  --> "0" 
				
$migrationArray	
, , 1							## There is only one ", , 1" interval assigned to gene flow
									## therefore, it is asummed to be constant.
     [,1] [,2]		## It is asymmetric because
[1,]   NA    1		## there is gene flow from group [1,] to group [,2]  --> "1" 
[2,]    0   NA		## but no gene flow from group [2,] to group [,1]    --> "0" 
```

No modifications to the models so far.

#### Gene flow only during early stages of divergence

To generate a model when gene flow only occured during a given time interval, a "standard" `migrationArray` object has to be changed using the function `AddEventToMigrationArray`. We are going to use as a template model 2 because it already includes a migration matrix with gene flow.

 ```r
 ## Add model of ancenstral migration
 migrationArray[[3]]<-AddEventToMigrationArray(migrationArray[[2]], 1, migrationMat=0)[[1]]
 length(migrationArray)
 #[1] 3 
 migrationArray[[3]]
 ```

Returns an output in which `$collapseMatrix` has a new column because we are adding a time interval, but we still have only 2 groups, therefore there are no coalescent events to be added, and we see `NA`.   
```r
$collapseMatrix
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   NA    1
[2,]   NA    1

```

Also, `$n0multiplierMap` and `$growthMap` have a new column because the new time interval was added to the entire model. In `$n0multiplierMap` we see `1` in the new column because the groups did not disappear in the new time interval, and `1` indicates that they "exist". But in `$growthMap` we see `0` because the population size did not chance. Could it be `1` instead? Yes, if you want to add population expansion or contraction (`1` indicates that there was a change that could be an increase or decrease), but for now we are not focussing on that. 

```r
$n0multiplierMap
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    1
[2,]    1    1

$growthMap
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    0    0
[2,]    0    0
```

Therefore, `$migrationArray` is expanded from one to two matrices, where the fist one `, , 1` represents gene flow during the first time interval from the present to the past (recent gene flow), and the second one `, , 2` represents gene flow during the following time interval from the present to the past (ancestral gene flow). Because here we are building a model of *gene flow only during early stages of divergence*, the first matrix has `0` in both directions, and the second one is the initial matrix with asymmetric gene flow. The same structure applies to build a model of secondary contact (see example below). 

```r
$migrationArray
, , 1							## This is new matrix in the model
     [,1] [,2]		## It has 0 because we set "migrationMat=0" in "AddEventToMigrationArray"
[1,]   NA    0		## therefore, it is assumed that there is no gene flow in the present.
[2,]    0   NA

, , 2								## This is the matrix that was already in the model.							
     [,1] [,2]			## therefore, it will be assumed that gene flow
[1,]   NA    1			## only happened in the past.
[2,]    0   NA

```
In `GridSearch` you will specify when gene flow "stopped" (if you see it from the past to the present) or "started" (if you see it from the present to the past) using the argument `addedEventTime`.
**`PHRAPL` assumes that time in models goes from the present to the past.** Setting `addedEventTimeAsScalar=TRUE` will consider relative times that go from 0 to 1 and represent the *total time to coalescence ( or from divergence) between two groups, regardless of whether time intervals were added or not.*  Therefore if `addedEventTime=0.1` and `addedEventTimeAsScalar=TRUE` are set in the `GridSearch` of a model of ancestral gene flow, it will be assumed that during the first 10% of the evolutionary time of the groups there was no gene flow (we have `0`s in `$migrationArray [, , 1]`), and gene flow occurred during 90% of the evolutionary time of the groups until they reach a coalescent event. 



****
#### Secondary contact

**A new time interval is always added as the most recent event.** Therefore, to generate a model of secondary contact, we use a model with no gene flow and set `migrationMat=1`, because the migration matrix that will be added to `$migrationArray` will have `1` in the first time interval (secondary contact) and we already have `0` in the now second migration matrix.

```r
## Add model of secondary contact
migrationArray[[4]]<-AddEventToMigrationArray(migrationArray[[1]], 1, migrationMat=1)[[1]]
```

Therefore, a model with no gene flow goes from:
```r
$collapseMatrix
     [,1]			
[1,]    1			
[2,]    1			

$complete
[1] TRUE

$n0multiplierMap	
     [,1]
[1,]    1			
[2,]    1			 

$growthMap
     [,1]
[1,]    0			 
[2,]    0			
						
$migrationArray
, , 1											
     [,1] [,2]		
[1,]   NA    0			
[2,]    0   NA		

```

To:

```r
$collapseMatrix
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   NA    1
[2,]   NA    1

$complete
[1] TRUE

$n0multiplierMap
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    1
[2,]    1    1

$growthMap
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    0    0
[2,]    0    0

$migrationArray
, , 1										## This is new matrix in the model
     [,1] [,2]					## It has 0 because we set "migrationMat=0" 
[1,]   NA    1					## in "AddEventToMigrationArray"
[2,]    1   NA					## therefore, there is gene flow in the present.

, , 2										## This is the matrix that was already in the model.
     [,1] [,2]					## therefore, it will be assumed that there wasn't gene flow
[1,]   NA    0					## in the past.
[2,]    0   NA

```

As in the previous example, in `GridSearch` you will specify when gene flow "started" (if you see it from the past to the present) or "stopped" (if you see it from the present to the past) using the argument `addedEventTime`. Remember, **`PHRAPL` assumes that time in models goes from the present to the past.** Setting `addedEventTimeAsScalar=TRUE` will consider relative times that go from 0 to 1 and represent the *total time to coalescence ( or from divergence) between two groups, regardless of whether time intervals were added or not.*  Therefore if `addedEventTime=0.1` and `addedEventTimeAsScalar=TRUE` are set in the `GridSearch` of a model of secondary contact, it will be assumed that gene flow only occurred during the most recent 10% interval of the evolutionary time of the groups (we have `1`s in `$migrationArray [, , 1]`), and gene flow did not occurred during 90% of the evolutionary time of the groups.

### Potential errors when creating models with extra time intervals

```r
AddEventToMigrationArray(migrationArray[[1]], 2)
## returns an error because there is not a second collapse event
## we only have 2 groups == 1 coalescent/divergence event
```

****
### Run `GridSearch` and compare models

Once you have a set of models, the analyses (subsampling, GridSearch, and post-processing) are exactly as decribed in other tutorials (See tutorial 1 for a detailed explanation of each step).

The [script that started running at beginning of this tutorial](https://github.com/ariadnamorales/phrapl-manual/raw/master/data/tutorial2.2/scripts/2.2.buildModels_loadData_Subsampling_GridSearch_Post.R), includes all the requred steps to calculate wAICs and compare models.

This table shows that model 4 (secondary contact) achieved a wAIC close to 1, meaning it has a very strong support.
