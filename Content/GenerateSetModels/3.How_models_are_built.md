# HOW MODELS ARE BUILT IN **<font color='#006579'>PHRAPL</font>**
{: .no_toc }

To run `PHRAPL` you need a set of models and it is important to understand how these models are built. __<font color='#ff7700'>Please take some time to read and understand how the free parameters are assigned in PHRAPL models.</font>__
 
## Free parameters
{: .no_toc }

`PHRAPL` will assign a certain number of free parameters (specified by the user or automatically) to __population sizes, coalescent events, population growth, and migration rates.__ 
1. TOC
{:toc}
The number of free parameters will constrain the possible number of histories that can be explored (model space search). For _n_ sampled populations, the number of possible models will increase factorially.

Therefore, `PHRAPL` is more efficient with 2 or 3 population models. If you want to analyze models with more populations, it is required to **filter the set models that will be examined.** Otherwise, it would be a waste of computational resources.

### **Population sizes - special case**
**`PHRAPL` will always assign one parameter to population size**, otherwise the populations do not exist. This parameter used for population size for the moment is not completely "free", and should not be counted to generate a 'migrationArray' object.

Fig. An example of free parameter assignments to population size when K=0, K=1, and K=2. There are no coalescent or migration events.


### **Collapse (or coalescent) event**
There are [(2n)-1] possible events of populations merging (coalescent events). Each coalescent event will require one parameter. If this value is 0, your system represents an island population model.

### **Population growth**
Changes in population size before or after a coalescent event.


### **Migration**
There are (N^2 - N) possible migration rates between populations.
