#HOW MODELS ARE BUILT IN `PHRAPL`?
{: .no_toc }

To run `PHRAPL` you need is a set of models and you need to understand how these models are built. __<font color='#ff7700'>Please take some time to read and understand how the free parameters are assigned.</font>__
 
## Free parameters
{: .no_toc }

`PHRAPL` will assign a certain number of free parameters (specified by the user or automatically) to __population sizes, coalescent events, population growth, and migration rates.__ 
1. TOC
{:toc}
The number of free parameters will constrain the possible number of histories (model space search). For _n_ sampled populations, the number of possible models will increase factorially.

## Free parameters
{: .no_toc }

### Population sizes - **special case**
**`PHRAPL` will always assign one parameter to population size**, otherwise the populations do not exist. Thie first parameter used for populations size for the moment is not completely "free", and should not be counted to generate a 'migrationArray' object.

### Collapse (or coalescent) event 
There are $[(2n)-1]$ possible events of populations merging (coalescent events). Each coalescent event will require one parameter. If this value is 0, your system represents an island population model.

Fig. An example of free parameter assignments to coalescent events when K=1, K=2, and K=3. There are not migration events.

### Population growth



### Migration
There are $(N^2 - N)$ possible migration rates between populations.
