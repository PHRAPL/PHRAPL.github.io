GENERATE A SET OF MODELS
=======



## What is a `migrationArray` object?

A `migrationArray` object will list the models that will be explored by `PHRAPL`. Depending on your question, you only need to generate a `migrationArray` object once for a specific number of populations, migration rates, collapse events, and/or population sizes.

We recommend generating a `migrationArray` object with a full set of models (i.e. isolation-only, migration-only and, isolation-with-migration) forcing symmetric migration. Then fix one or a few topologies and allow asymmetric migration.

## Generating a `migrationArray` object
This example generates a set of models for 3 population, where symmetric migration is forced and all possible topologies will be included.

migrationArray<-GenerateMigrationIndividuals(
popVector=c(2,2,2),               # how many population/species/groups do you have? If you have 2, then type c(2,2) or c(3,3) [the number of individuals doesn't matter here]. In this example, there are 3 populations.
maxK=3,                           # maximum number of parameters in total (considering migration rates and coalescent events)
maxMigrationK=1,                  # maximum number of parameters that will be assigned to migration rates
maxN0K=1,                         # maximum number of parameters that will be assigned to population sizes
maxGrowthK=0,                     # maximum number of growth parameters that will be incorporated into the model set
forceSymmetricalMigration=TRUE,   # Do you want to generate a set of models with symmetric migration among all populations? (TRUE/FALSE)
forceTree=FALSE)                  # Do you want to force all population to collapse? (if TRUE only fully-resolved trees will be included in the set of models)
 
migrationArrayMap<-GenerateMigrationArrayMap(migrationArray) 
save(migrationArray,migrationArrayMap, file="MigrationArray_3Pop_4K.rda")
```


This example generates a set of models for 3 population, where asymmetric migration is allowed and two topologies are fixed.
