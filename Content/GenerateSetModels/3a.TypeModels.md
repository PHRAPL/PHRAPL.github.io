if this fIgure looks odd to you, go to [How models are built in  **<font color='#006579'>PHRAPL</font>**](https://phrapl.github.io/Content/GenerateSetModels) and read about how parameters are assigned to models in `PHRAPL`.

## Isolation Only (IO)
Models that do not include migration events, but can include multiple coalescent events, population sizes and, changes in population size. All populations/species need to coalesce at some point.


## Isolation with Migration (IM)
These are the most flexible models that can be explored in `PHRAPL`. These models can include coalescent events, multiple migration rates, population sizes, and changes in population size. 
It not required for all populations/species to coalesce. But if a population does not coalesce with others, it needs to be connected by migration.
The migration does not have to be constant, and it is possible to test if gene flow only occurred either recently (secondary contact) or at early stages of divergence (speciation with gene flow). See `AddEventToMigrationArray` for more info.


### Constant migration
Migration between or from one population to another constantly occurs at the same rate.

### Ancestral migration
Migration only occurs after divergence, but it stops at some point and does not occur in the present. It is possible to specify in `PHRAPL`when migration stopped.

### Secondary contact
Migration stopped after divergence, but it started at some point and still occurs in the present. It is possible to specify in `PHRAPL`when migration started.

## Migration Only (MI)
Models that do not include coalescent events but can consist of multiple migration rates, population sizes, and changes in population size.
