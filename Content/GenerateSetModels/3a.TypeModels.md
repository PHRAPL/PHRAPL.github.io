if this fIgure looks odd to you, go to [How models are built in  **<font color='#006579'>PHRAPL</font>**](https://phrapl.github.io/Content/GenerateSetModels) and read about how parameters are assigned to models in `PHRAPL`.

## Isolation Only (IO)
Models that do not include migration events, but can include multiple coalescent events, population sizes and, changes in population size. All populations/species need to coalesce at some point.


## Isolation with Migration (IM)
These are the most flexible models that can be explored in `PHRAPL`. These models can include coalescent events, multiple migration rates, different population sizes, and changes in population size (e.g. exponential growth). 
It is not required for all populations/species to coalesce. But if a population does not coalesce with others, it needs to be connected by migration.
Migration rates between populations can be symmetric or asymmetric and can change over time. For example, migration may be constant or occur either recently (secondary contact) or at early stages of divergence (speciation with gene flow). See `AddEventToMigrationArray` for more info on how to build these type of models.


### Constant migration
Migration between populations or from one population to another constantly occurs at the same rate.

### Ancestral migration
Migration only occurs after divergence, but it stops at some point and does not occur in the present. It is possible to specify in `PHRAPL`when migration stopped using the arguments `addedEventTime`and `addedEventTimeAsScalar`in the `GridSearch`function.

### Secondary contact
Migration stopped after divergence, but it started at some point and still occurs in the present. It is possible to specify in `PHRAPL`when migration started using the arguments `addedEventTime`and `addedEventTimeAsScalar`in the `GridSearch`function.

## Migration Only (MO)
Models that do not include coalescent events but can consist of multiple migration rates, population sizes, and changes in population size.
