devtools::install_github("bomeara/phrapl")
```

```

# Install requirements
`PHRAPL` requires `R`, `ms`, and `perl` to be installed in your computer. 

## Installing R
Go to the following web page (http://www.r-project.org) and download the suitable version for your platform.

## Installing ms
Go to the web page (http://home.uchicago.edu/~rhudson1/source/mksamples.html) and download ms.tar.gz.
Or in your terminal window type: 

```
wget https://webshare.uchicago.edu/users/rhudson1/Public/ms.folder/ms.tar.gz
```

The following commands will extract, compile the program and add it to your PATH:
```
tar -xvf ms.tar
cd msdir
gcc -o ms ms.c streec.c rand1.c -lm
sudo cp ms /usr/bin
sudo cp ms /usr/lib
```
It is not required to add `ms` to your PATH, you can specify its location in the `GridSearch`function.


## Installing perl
If you are working on a Linux or Mac OS X platform, PERL will already be installed. If you are using Windows go to [this page](http://learn.perl.org/installing/windows.html) and download the suitable version for your platform.
